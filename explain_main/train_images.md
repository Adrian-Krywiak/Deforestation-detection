# Deep Learning for Deforestation Detection

## Step 1: Import libraries
- `tensorflow`: main library for building and training deep learning models.
- `numpy`: used for numerical operations and manipulating arrays.
- `os` and `glob`: used for file and directory handling.
- `cv2` (OpenCV): used for reading and processing image files.
- `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`: used for splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Step 2: Define the load_data function
- The function takes two directory paths as input: one for forested images and one for deforested images.
- It iterates over each image file in the directories, reads the images using `cv2.imread()`, resizes them to a consistent size (e.g., 64x64), and appends them to their respective lists: `forested_images` and `deforested_images`.
- The function creates a combined array (X) containing all the images and a corresponding array of labels (y) with 0 for forested and 1 for deforested images.
- It splits the data into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn`. This function shuffles the data and allocates a percentage (e.g., 20%) for testing, while the rest is used for training.

## Step 3: Load and preprocess the data
- Define the directories for forested and deforested images.
- Call the `load_data` function to load and split the data.
- Normalize the pixel values of the images by dividing by 255.0, so they are between 0 and 1. Normalizing the data helps the neural network converge faster during training.

## Step 4: Create the CNN model
- Define a sequential model using the `tf.keras.models.Sequential` class. This allows you to build a neural network by stacking layers sequentially.
- Add three convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions. Convolutional layers learn spatial features from the input images using convolution operations. The ReLU activation function adds non-linearity to the model and helps the network learn complex patterns.
- Follow each convolutional layer with a max-pooling layer. Max-pooling layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the output by taking the maximum value in a local neighborhood (e.g., 2x2).
- Flatten the output from the last convolutional layer. This step converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, which can be fed into the following fully connected layers.
- Add two fully connected layers (dense layers). The first dense layer has more units (e.g., 64) and a ReLU activation function. The final layer has two output units (one for each class: forested and deforested) and a softmax activation function, which outputs the probability distribution over the two classes.

## Step 5: Compile and train the model
- Compile the model with the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. It helps the model converge faster during training.
- Use the Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems with integer labels.
- Use the accuracy metric to track the model's performance during training.
- Train the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs (e.g., 10) and validate it using the testing data. One epoch is a complete iteration through the training dataset.

## Step 6: Evaluate the model
- Evaluate the trained model on the test data to get the test loss and test accuracy. This step provides an unbiased assessment of the model's performance on unseen data.
- Print the test accuracy and loss to understand the model's performance.
